# shop managment and order making app build on Meteor platfrom

The management of business establishments like restaurants and coffee shops is not an easy task. 
There are a lot of things a manager has to overcome, some of them are the menu creation, the proper
staff management and of course the proper tools for the job for maximum performance. It was not long
ago when the only tool a waiter had to take orders, was a paper and a pen. A lot has changed since 
then as lately almost all of them use a PDA (electronic digital assistant) and now they have the 
privilege to use their own mobile phones for order taking, menu configuration and even manage their
whole bysiness. 
The purpose of the current diploma thesis is to create such a tool-service in conjunction with extracting
information and conclusions about the menu items, staff and days, a dunamic web application for similar 
stores, using Meteor platform and NoSQL database, combined using Javascript, HTML and CSS programming
while tools like React, DOM and several Meteor packages. 
The application is available both on a PC and a mobile device by using only the web browser. 
Here is a detailed explanation of the difficulties and the possible facilitations the application has
to offer as well as descriptions of the tools used and step-by-step the development of the application and its functions.
